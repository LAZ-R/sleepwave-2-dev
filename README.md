Inspired by sites like [myNoise.net](https://mynoise.net/), **SLEEPWAVE** takes a new spin on the soundscape generator concept by letting **you** decide the playing frequency of various events.  

Each available sound is one of 3 types :

- `Background`  
This is your default type, the one you've already witnessed elsewhere. Just a long background sample, playing in a loop, starting at a random point.  

- `Event`  
The backbone of the **SLEEPWAVE** concept.  
This is a relativly short sample, which is played at the repetition frequency **you** decide, with random potential skipping (which you also define).  

- `Events pack`  
Just like the `Event` type, but with **multiple** samples randomly chosen to be played.

This is mostly a *proof of concept* so the code here is awfull, I know.
